      <h1>habitable zones around M-dwarfs</h1>
      <hr />
      The habitability of planets around M-dwarfs is heavily debated, with a
      common argument against being the volatility of M-dwarfs and their
      heightened stellar activity which could sterilise nearby planets.<br />
      However, research conducted by
      <a href="#1">[ Jun Yang et al ]</a> suggests that the inclusion of cloud
      simulation could greatly increase the expected widths of the habitable
      zones for tidally-locked planets in M-dwarf systems.
      <hr />
      <br />
      Incorporating cloud systems into 1D radiative-convective transfer models for determining the inner
      edge of the habitable zone could double the stellar
      flux at which a tidally locked planet can be considered
      habitable - effectively doubling the number of habitable planets
      around M dwarfs. <br><br> High stellar flux at the surface of a planet with
      plentiful water drives strong convection producing thick water clouds that
      increase planetary albedo. As cloud formation is also greater at areas
      with high insolation, this produces a stabilising feedback loop. <br><br>Research
      by J Yang et al. suggests that tidally locked planets have a higher
      albedo, lower greenhouse effect, and therefore temperatures low enough to
      be considered habitable. The temperature difference across the day and
      night sides of the planet is also mitigated by strong radiative cooling on
      the night side and atmospheric energy transport from the day side to the
      night side.
