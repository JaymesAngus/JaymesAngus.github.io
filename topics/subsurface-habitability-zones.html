      <h1>subsurface-habitability zones</h1>
      <hr />
      Organisms have been found to exist at depth of up to several km under the
      Earth's surface in fissures and porous rocks. A paper by McMahon et al. proposed the
      term "subsurface-habitablility zone"<a href="#1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to described the
      increased range around a host star at which life on an
      exoplanet may survive at some depth under the planetary
      surface.<br><br>
      This concept can also be applied to icy moons harbouring liquid oceans beneath
      vast layers of ice, such as Jupiter's moon Europa and potentially Saturn's Mimas<a href="#2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
      Our understanding of gas giants suggests that most would exhibit strong magnetospheres which could accelerate
      charged particles to relativistic speeds. Thick surface ice on moons orbiting these giants could provide shelter
      from that intense radiation.
      <br><br>If tidal heating or geothermal energy was sufficient to allow for liquid water, then icy moons should
      in theory be habitable regardless of distance from their host star.
