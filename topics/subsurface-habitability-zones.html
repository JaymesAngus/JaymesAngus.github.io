      <h1>Subsurface-habitability zones</h1>
      <hr />
      Organisms have been found to exist at depth of up to several km under the
      Earth's surface in fissures and porous rocks. McMahon et al. proposed the
      term "subsurface-habitablility zone" to described the
      increased range around a host star at which life on an
      exoplanet may survive at some depth under the planetary
      surface.
