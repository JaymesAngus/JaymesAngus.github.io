        The concept of a digital garden refers to construct somewhere between a blog and a commomplace book; in the sense that it is neither static
        and logged like a blog, but unlike a commonplace book it does follow some kind of structure. This structure, along with the meaning of
        the term 'digital gardening', will change from person-to-person, but will follow the same basic principles.
        This page will provide a better description of what digital gardening means to me, and, with any luck, might provide an introduction to the
        concept for a handful of readers.

        I took inspiration from Mark Bernstein's essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/" class="textlink">[ Hypertext Gardens ]</a> when 
        setting off to make a digital garden. In it he compares some websites to wildernesses, promising adventure and discovery if you can navigate
        their tangled expanse. Others are more akin to cities, with their highly efficient layouts and user-friendly (if repetitive and ultimately 
        unexciting) design. Gardens strike a balance between these two landscapes. They offer the allure of the wilderness in a more safe 
        and contained environment.

        Some pages on this site are not listed on any internal index; they may only be accessed either by their direct link or by stumbling across 
        them through other pages. This is perhaps not a "smart" web design choice, but it does incentivise a more in-depth exploration of the 
        content for those who, like me, prefer that style of navigation. The virtues of flattened layouts where everything is accessible within 
        a few clicks have been extolled to no end by various design sources, but the most engaging experiences I've had online have been with 
        websites that take the opposite approach. So often the tangents and distractions I experience in my search for some specific piece of 
        information are more insightful than the piece itself.

      <h3>my intentions for this garden</h3>
      <p>
        At the moment I'm still experimenting with the current hyperminimal design for this website. However, if I wanted a totally standardised 
        series of notes I'd just use <a href="obsidian" class="textlink">[ obsidian ]</a>. I have a vague notion to play around with the 
        structure and format of the text more in future works, rotating it and altering the font for a start. I do very much intend to keep 
        these pages as lightweight as possible though, which means no javascript and ideally minimal CSS.
