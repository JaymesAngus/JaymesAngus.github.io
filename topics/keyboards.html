        I started using an OLKB Planck keyboard in June 2022 and was immediately captivated by its open-ended nature.
        It started out as a challenge, an experiment in redundancy to see how much I could give up without detrimental 
        effects on my workflow, which quickly morphed into a totally new way of interacting with my computer.
        With a 40% ortholinear layout, the most striking feature of this keyboard is the total lack of a number row. 
        The Planck is not however a test of endurance and loss, it represents a far richer typing experience than that of
        any other keyboard I've tried.<br><br>
        I know this all sounds very grand, and possibly excessive for a piece of tech that we all take for granted, but I
        mean it wholeheartedly. While only having 48 physical keys, the Planck utilises a technique called layer switching 
        to allow for a functionally limitless number of virtual keys and macros.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>layer switching</h2>
      <p>
        The principle of layer switching is not unique to the Planck or any other QMK powered keyboard. Every time you hold shift to produce 
        the capitalised version of a letter, you're temporarily switching to a layer in which all letters on your keyboard are capitalised. 
        This same layer also turns your numbers into symbols. What makes a keyboard like the Planck so unique is that you have <i>complete 
        control</i> over the number and function of these layers. Instead of stretching out to hit a number button at the edge of your 
        reach, you can just tap one of two (by default) layer keys with your thumb to temporarily change your home row into a number row. 
        Hit the other layer key and those same buttons become your symbol row.

      <h2>colemak and other layouts</h2>
      <p>
      You may have noticed from the image at the top that I have not used the standard qwerty layout for this keyboard. In fact, to this 
      day I continue to use Colemak mod-DH on the Planck (though I return reluctantly to qwerty on every other device). I'm often asked
      why I would choose to spend the time relearning how to type on a keyboard, and the most simple answer is: why not? Getting used to
      an ortholinear layout was already going to be a challenge, and I'd heard nothing but praise from people who had already made the switch.
      </p>
      <p>
      I will always recommend that anyone who spends a significant amount of time writing on a computer should at least consider switching
      to a Colemak or even Dvorak layout. This is because the qwerty layout was designed in the <i>1870s</i>, and in a way that
      would result in less typewriter jams by spacing out letters that frequently appear together. This, personally, seems about as
      as inefficient as you can get. We're just used to it because it's been the standard for as long as anyone alive today can remember. 
      Typing in Colemak just feels so much more smooth. Your fingers rarely depart from the home row, and the 
      benefits of an ortholinear keyboard go hand in hand with this ergonomic improvement.
      </p>
      <p>It was arguably this image, a heatmap of 10,000 simple sentences from wikipedia produced by reddit user u/ miraj31415, that 
        gave me the final shove I needed to design my keyboard layout around Colemak rather than Qwerty.
