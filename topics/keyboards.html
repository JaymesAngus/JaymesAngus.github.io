        I started using an OLKB Planck keyboard in June 2022 and haven't looked back since. I initially bought it as an experiment in redundancy, to see just how much functionality I could remove while still being able to perform all my usual tasks on a computer, but this goal changed within days of getting my hands on the board. With the built-in <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/" class="textlink">[ QMK firmware ]</a>, the concept of redundancy was itself redundant. Despite only having 48 physical keys, the Planck utilises the principle of layer switching to ensure that not only can you include every key present on a full-sized conventional keyboard, but literally hundreds more - for any purpose you could dream of.

      <h3>layer switching</h3>
      <p>
        The principle of layer switching is not unique to the Planck or any other QMK powered keyboard. Every time you hold shift to produce the capitalised version of a letter, you're temporarily switching to a layer in which all letters on your keyboard are capitalised. This same layer also turns your numbers into symbols. What makes a keyboard like the Planck so unique is that you have <i>complete control</i> over the number and function of these layers. Instead of stretching out to hit a number button at the edge of your reach, you can just tap one of two (by default) layer keys with your thumb to temporarily change your home row into a number row. Hit the other layer key and those same buttons become your symbol row.
