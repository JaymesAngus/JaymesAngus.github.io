      The mass of cobwebs spun across the entrance to the tomb provide little resistance as you make your way inside. Taking a torch from your pack, your strike steel against flint and ignite the fat-soaked cloth to cast an uncertain glow over the barren chamber. Rotten cloth and the tangled remains of what may once have been a tent tell of those who took refuge here before. Whether they left unscathed or met their end deep within the labyrinths below cannot be known.
      <br><br>
      The relative seclusion of this area may afford you a chance to examine your equipment, but your torch is of poor quality and time is therefore precious.
