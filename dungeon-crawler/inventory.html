      <hr />
      Desperation brought you here, and the contents of your salvaged pack reflect this impoverished state. You have upon your person:<br><br>
      - two torches, including the one currently lit <br>
      - the tinderbox with which you lit your torch<br>
      - a length of rope, perhaps fifteen cubits in length<br>
      - a waterskin
      - a hammer<br>
      - a rondel dagger<br><br>

      Instinct draws your attention to the waterskin. Lifting it from the pack, you find it uncapped and nearly empty. A sharp oath resonates through the chamber.
      After a moment's pause you recall the teardrops of the silent figures outside, purified by verdant lichen. Passing once more through the rupture in the gateway you stand before
      one and bring your waterskin to its cheek, all the while unable to shake the sensation of being watched from afar. Once back inside the chamber, you secure the cap and
      shoulder your pack. The cloth wrapping of the torch has begun to blacken but it burns yet.
