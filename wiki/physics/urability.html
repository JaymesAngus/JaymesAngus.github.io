        <p>
          Urability is a term that you probably haven't heard before. It was
          coined in 2022 by David Deamer, Francesca Cary, and Bruce Damer in a
          paper entitled
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2021.0173" class="textlink">
            <i>Urability: A Property of Planetary Bodies That Can Support an Origin of Life</i>.
          </a>
          Those with an interest in astrobiology may immediately recognise this
          as similar to the concept of habitability; but the crucial distinction
          between these two properties is that while habitability determines
          whether life could persist in an environment, urability determines
          whether life could originate in that environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, here on Earth we have extremophiles that thrive in
          conditions of extreme heat, salinity, or pH. These harsh environments
          are therefore habitable (albeit to a strange class of organisms), but
          are not particularly welcoming for simple microbial life - which would
          be unlikely to arise there in an abitrary time.
