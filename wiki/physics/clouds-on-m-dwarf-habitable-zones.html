        <h1>Cloud physics widen the habitable zone around M-dwarfs</h1>
        <hr />
        The habitability of planets around M-dwarfs is heavily debated, with a
        common argument against being the volatility of M-dwarfs and their
        heightened stellar activity which could sterilise nearby planets.<br />
        However, research conducted by
        <a href="#1">[ Jun Yang et al ]</a> suggests that the inclusion of cloud
        simulation could greatly increase the expected widths of the habitable
        zones for tidally-locked planets in M-dwarf systems.
        <hr />
        <br />
        Incorporating cloud systems into 1D radiative-convective transfer models for determining the inner
        edge of the habitable zone could double the stellar
        flux at which a tidally locked planet can be considered
        habitable - effectively doubling the number of habitable planets
        around M dwarfs. <br><br> High stellar flux at the surface of a planet with
        plentiful water drives strong convection producing thick water clouds that
        increase planetary albedo. As cloud formation is also greater at areas
        with high insolation, this produces a stabilising feedback loop. <br><br>Research
        by J Yang et al. suggests that tidally locked planets have a higher
        albedo, lower greenhouse effect, and therefore temperatures low enough to
        be considered habitable. The temperature difference across the day and
        night sides of the planet is also mitigated by strong radiative cooling on
        the night side and atmospheric energy transport from the day side to the
        night side.
