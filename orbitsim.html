      <h3>Overview</h3>
      The orbital simulation project began as the final assignment for the Computational Astrophysics module offered at the University of St Andrews. The aim was to utilise the <a href="#fortran" class="textlink">[fortran]</a> programming language to perform simple Newtonian dynamics calculations regarding the gravitational attraction of two or more bodies. The results of these calculations would then be written to a file so that the orbital paths could be visualised in Python using the Matplotlib library. The results were highly satisfactory, both for their visualisation and their physical accuracy.<br><br>
      The following images show the results of a six-body simulation in both a spherical (left) and asymmetrical (right) mean galactic potential.<br><br>
