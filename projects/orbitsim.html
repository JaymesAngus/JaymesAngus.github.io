      <h1>simulating gravitational orbits with fortran</h1>

      <h3>overview</h3>
      The orbital simulation project began as the final assignment for the
      Computational Astrophysics module offered at the University of St Andrews.
      The aim was to utilise the
      <a href="#fortran" class="textlink">[fortran]</a> programming language to
      perform simple Newtonian dynamics calculations regarding the gravitational
      attraction of two or more bodies. The results of these calculations would
      then be written to a file so that the orbital paths could be visualised in
      Python using the Matplotlib library. The results were highly satisfactory,
      both for their visualisation and their physical accuracy.<br /><br />

      The following images show the results of a six-body simulation in both a
      spherical (upper) and asymmetrical (lower) mean galactic potential.<br /><br />

      <h3 id="fortran">why fortran</h3>
      Fortran has maintained a steady usage in the computational sciences for
      its speed and optimisation. It is a language designed for high-speed
      numerical operations. This made it ideal for a basic orbital simulator,
      where the main requirement was the rapid solving of a second order
      differential equation - a relatively simple mathematical process. Learning
      to work with a compiled language took a degree of patience for me, having
      only ever used Python before, but I know that had I attempted this project
      in Python I would have become swamped in unnecessary for-loops and list
      appendages - something Fortran simply does not allow you to do.
