      <h1>simulating gravitational orbits with fortran</h1>
      <hr />

      <h3>overview</h3>
      The orbital simulation project began as the final assignment for a
      Computational Astrophysics module offered at the University of St Andrews.
      The aim was to create a program using
      <a href="#fortran" class="textlink">[fortran]</a> that would solve for the
      motion of N bodies under their mutual gravitational interaction. Over a series of
      time steps the positions and velocities of each body were stored in an array,
      which was then written to an external file so that the
      orbital paths could be visualised using the Matplotlib Python library.
      <br></br>
      Physical accuracy of the simulation was tested using three parameters: conservation of
      momentum, conservation of energy, and conservation of position after one closed orbit.

      <h3 id="fortran">why fortran?</h3>
      Fortran has maintained a steady usage in the computational sciences for
      its speed and optimisation. It is a language designed for high-speed
      numerical operations, making it ideal for a basic orbital simulator
      where the main computational component was the solving of a second order
      differential equation. Learning
      to work with a compiled language took a degree of patience for me, having
      only ever used Python before, but I know that had I attempted this project
      in Python I would have become swamped in unnecessary for-loops and list
      appendages - something Fortran simply does not allow you to do.

      <h3 id="visualisation">visualisation with matplotlib</h3>
      Plotting static orbit paths from the resulting data files was as easy as loading
      them into a Python file and generating a matplotlib graph, which is exactly what I
      did for the two images above.
      <br>
      The advantage to animated visualisation of the data was that erratic behaviour was easier
      to diagnose. 
      However, when it came to animating the orbits a tradeoff had to be made. The variable
      timestep that I had implemented meant that the orbits seemed to slow down whenever
      two or more massive bodies approached each other. This was due to the animation process
      assuming that each position vector was recorded at an equal timestep.
