        <h3>Overview</h3>
        Following the initial success of the orbital simulation project, I wanted
        to see if I could apply what I'd learned to something more complex. The
        collision physics project was initially supposed to be a minor addition to
        the orbital code to avoid situations in which massive bodies would pass
        through each other. In accordance with Newton's law of gravitation, as the
        distance between the bodies approached zero the force between them
        approached infinity. I quickly realised that this would be more
        challenging to implement if I wanted the collisions to be remotely
        physically accurate. This project is still very much in its early stages,
        and I have been contemplating switching to another language to better
        realise my goals with it.
