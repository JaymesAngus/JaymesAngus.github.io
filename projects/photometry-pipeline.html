      <h1>Photometry pipeline</h1>
      <hr />
      During the summer of 2023 I worked alongside Juan Santisteban of the
      University of St Andrews to develop a source identification and photometry
      pipeline. The goal was to feed this pipeline a folder of astronomical
      .fits images, have it identify all astronomical sources, then produce a
      series of light curves from selected targets.<br>
      The most significant
      challenges in this project stemmed from target tracking and ensuring
      that the code would be able to reliably identify the same source
      regardless of image transformation or rotation.<br>
      This pipeline will be used
      to characterise the OPTICAM imaging system, then produce and analyse
      photometric data from selected cataclysmic binary systems.

      <br />
      <h3>current status</h3>
      The pipeline can now load all fits images from a specified directory,
      identify sources within those images, and perform photometry on them
      automatically. Most importantly, it can assign IDs to each star so that
      they can be tracked across each image. This was achieved using the
      AstroAlign library and by storing sequences of coordinates corresponding
      to the positions of each star across the different images. As of now
      AstroAlign itself is used to detect sources, but the issue we're currently
      facing is that if it fails to detect the transform between two images then
      we cannot assign the correct ID to stars in subsequent images. <br />It
      seems to be that if the list of coordinates passed into the find_transform
      function is too short, AA exhausts the possible configurations in which
      those sources could be matched to those in the subsequent image before
      finding the correct transform.<br /><br />
      This is the first successful lightcurve output from a series of one
      thousand images.

      <h3>next steps</h3>
      We now know that errors returned by AstroAlign from the find_transform
      function are not due to issues with the fits images themselves, but with
      the list of source coordinates passsed into that function. Once a method
      has been found to correct this fault, the next step will be to implement a
      function which determines the optimum aperture size for photometry. This
      will require a curve of growth to be created for all stars, but should
      only be required to run on the first image of the dataset.
