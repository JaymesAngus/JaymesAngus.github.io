        <h1>Photometry pipeline</h1>
        <hr />
        During the summer of 2023 I worked alongside Juan Santisteban of the
        University of St Andrews to develop a source identification and photometry
        pipeline. The goal was to feed this pipeline a folder of astronomical
        .fits images, have it identify all astronomical sources, then produce a
        series of light curves from selected targets.<br>
        The most significant
        challenges in this project stemmed from target tracking and ensuring
        that the code would be able to reliably identify the same source
        regardless of image transformation or rotation.<br>
        This pipeline will be used
        to characterise the OPTICAM imaging system, then produce and analyse
        photometric data from selected cataclysmic binary systems.

        <br />
        <h3>current status</h3>
        The pipeline can now load all fits images from a specified directory,
        identify sources within those images, and perform photometry on them
        automatically. Most importantly, it can assign IDs to each star so that
        they can be tracked across each image. This was achieved using the
        AstroAlign library and by storing sequences of coordinates corresponding
        to the positions of each star across the different images. As of now
        AstroAlign itself is used to detect sources, but the issue we're currently
        facing is that if it fails to detect the transform between two images then
        we cannot assign the correct ID to stars in subsequent images. <br />It
        seems to be that if the list of coordinates passed into the find_transform
        function is too short, AA exhausts the possible configurations in which
        those sources could be matched to those in the subsequent image before
        finding the correct transform.<br /><br />
        This is the first successful lightcurve output from a series of one
        thousand images.

        <h3>next steps</h3>
        We now know that errors returned by AstroAlign from the find_transform
        function are not due to issues with the fits images themselves, but with
        the list of source coordinates passsed into that function. Once a method
        has been found to correct this fault, the next step will be to implement a
        function which determines the optimum aperture size for photometry. This
        will require a curve of growth to be created for all stars, but should
        only be required to run on the first image of the dataset.
