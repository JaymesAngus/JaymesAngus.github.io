      <h1>photometry pipeline</h1>
      <hr />
      I am currently working in collaboration with Juan Santisteban of the
      University of St Andrews on a photometry pipeline which will produce
      lightcurves from a series of astronomical images.<br /><br />
      The goal is to produce a python script that will load a series of fits
      images, perform aperture photometry on sources detected in those images,
      and then automate a differential photometry process with a user-specified
      selection of stars.
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>current status</h3>
      The pipeline can now load all fits images from a specified directory,
      identify sources within those images, and perform photometry on them
      automatically. Most importantly, it can assign IDs to each star so that
      they can be tracked across each image. This was achieved using the
      AstroAlign library and by storing sequences of coordinates corresponding
      to the positions of each star across the different images. As of now
      AstroAlign itself is used to detect sources, but the issue we're currently
      facing is that if it fails to detect the transform between two images then
      we cannot assign the correct ID to stars in subsequent images. <br />It
      seems to be that if the list of coordinates passed into the find_transform
      function is too short, AA exhausts the possible configurations in which
      those sources could be matched to those in the subsequent image before
      finding the correct transform.<br /><br />
      This is the first successful lightcurve output from a series of one
      thousand images.

      <h3>next steps</h3>
      We now know that errors returned by AstroAlign from the find_transform
      function are not due to issues with the fits images themselves, but with
      the list of source coordinates passsed into that function. Once a method
      has been found to correct this fault, the next step will be to implement a
      function which determines the optimum aperture size for photometry. This
      will require a curve of growth to be created for all stars, but should
      only be required to run on the first image of the dataset.
