      <p>
        is the name of my final year dissertation for my MPhys degree.
        <br /><br />The animation on my homepage shows the model light curve
        for a simple gravitational microlensing
        event (solid line) followed by the simulated results of a ground-based
        telescope observation of the event (scatter plot).
        The blip on the right wing of the light curve is a planetary
        perturbation caused by the presence of a Jupiter analogue.<br /><br />
        This simulation is currently oversimplified as I have not yet implemented
        correlated noise into my model, but it has produced some interesting
        preliminary results!
