      <h1>Precision vs Cadence</h1>
      <h3><i>Simulating Observation of Weak Planetary Signals in Microlensing Events</i></h3>

      <p>
        is the title of my final year dissertation for my MPhys degree.

        When searching for exoplanets via gravitational microlensing events, the choice of imaging cadence is crucial. 
        Planetary perturbations to PSPL light curves may only last a few hours, setting an upper limit to the range
        of cadences at which they can be detected. For this reason, many observations opt to prioritise a high cadence over
        photometric precision. However, debate continues as to whether this approach is the most effective for identifying
        planetary signals.
        <br><br>
        For my MPhys dissertation I have simulated a realistic three-step microlensing search survey, experimenting with 
        various balances of precision vs cadence to identify an optimal search strategy. Model double-lens light curves 
        generated by the Python MulensModel package are injected into real astronomical data, which is then systematically 
        sampled to replicate the results of an exoplanet search.
