      <p>
        is the title of my final year dissertation for my MPhys degree.
        <br /><br />The animation on my homepage shows the model light curve
        for a simple gravitational microlensing
        event (solid line) followed by the simulated results of a ground-based
        telescope observation (scatter plot).
        The blip on the right wing of the light curve is a planetary
        perturbation caused by the presence of a Jupiter analogue.<br /><br />

        This simulation is an oversimplification as I have only included random Gaussian noise, but it has produced some interesting
        preliminary results!
