          <h1>Badger2040</h1>
          <hr />
          <br />
          The Badger2040 is a pocket-sized e-ink display programmable via micropython. It has three buttons and a neat built-in library
          of example programs like a to-do list and an ebook reader! Ability to accept limited user input and a way to display text? Sounds
          like the makings of a choose your own adventure game!<br /><br />
          The aim is to create a .py program that will take a folder of .txt story files and run a text-based game in which the player
          uses the three onboard buttons to navigate their way through a D&D style dungeon. Each txt story file will contain between one 
          and three progress options, which will be selected by pressing the corresponding button which will load the next txt story file.<br>
          Initially it will be a one-off story designed to take no more
          than five minutes, but eventually I want to expand it to be able to track player progress via txt save files.

          <h3>player selection</h3>
          The game is currently set up so that each txt file has the names of the linked story txt files on the first line. The first line
          is read in, and each individual word is used as the input for the function which will load the next story segment.
          I can instruct the bagder to ignore that first line when displaying the contents of the file, but if the player scrolls down and then
          scrolls back up it will appear with the rest of the text. To solve this issue, I'll either have to find a way to make that first line
          permanently invisible or change the way in which the story files are written. One idea would be to create a python class which stores the
          story and linked file names separately, accessing them as required.
