      <h1>the Monte Carlo simulation playbook</h1>
      <hr />
      A practical introduction to Monte Carlo radiation/particle transport code
      in fortran
      <hr />
      <br />
      <h3>basic overview</h3>
      Step one: emit a particle from a location \((x, y, z\)) in a direction
      $$\begin{align} \textbf{n} &= \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta \cos\phi \\
      \sin\theta \sin\phi \\ \cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \end{align}$$ Step two:
      move particle to new position at a distance dependent on the particle
      energy and optical properties/composition of the medium.<br /><br />

      Step three: determine the nature of the particle's interaction with the
      medium at that point;
      <ul>
        <li>
          Scattering event -
          <i
            >change direction, and possibly energy of particle, then calculate
            new step.</i
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Absorption in to medium -
          <i>absorb energy into medium, emit new particle</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Fission (only relevant for neutronics) -
          <i>produces secondary neutrons and photons</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Step three: repeat this for as many particles as you want to simulate,
      collect and absorb data according to your needs.
      <br /><br />
      <h3>monte carlo packets</h3>
      The most common particle in MC simulation is the Monte Carlo luminosity
      packet. For a total luminosity of \(L\), each packet carries an energy
      \(E_i = L \Delta t/N\); where \(N\) is the total number of packets and
      \(\Delta t\) is the physical time over which the simulation is being
      performed. \(\Delta t\) is what allows us to compute absorbed
      power/energy, and physical properties of the medium do not change over
      this timescale.
      <br />
      One MC packet represents \(N_\gamma\) real photons, where \(N_\gamma =
      E_i/h \nu_i\)
      <br /><br />
      For neutronics simulation, one MC packet represents one neutron.
      <br /><br />
      <h3>sampling a random optical depth</h3>
      If you don't know how to sample a random variable from an underlying
      distribution function, check out this quick primer on
      <a href="sampling-from-pdfs.html">[ random sampling from PDFs ]</a
      >.<br /><br />
      The probability for a particle to travel a distance \(\tau\) before
      interaction is \(P(\tau) = e^{-\tau}\). So we sample a random \(\tau\)
      from this distribution using $$\xi = \int_0^\tau e^{-\tau '} d\tau ' = 1 -
      e^{-\tau} \Rightarrow \tau = -\log(1-\xi)$$ Seeing as \(1-\xi\) is also a
      random number distributed uniformly between zero and one, we can simply
      this to $$\tau = -log(\xi)$$ The physical distance that a packet travels,
      \(L\), can therefore be derived from the equation $$\tau = \int_0^L
      n\sigma ds$$ which is easy to solve in the case of a uniform density
      medium: $$L = \tau ( s_{max}/\tau_{max} )$$
      <br /><br />
      <h3>sampling a random direction</h3>
      Given that directions in a sphere are determined by two angles \(\theta\)
      and \(\phi\), it's easy to imagine that you could sample a random solid
      angle by sampling those two angles from a uniform distribution. However,
      this causes a bunching up of point at higher latitudes (low \(\theta\)).
      <br><br> \(\theta\) is normalised over \([0, \pi]\) and \(\phi\) is
      normalised over \([0, 2\pi]\), so their respetive PDFs are $$p(\theta) =
      1/2 \sin\theta$$ $$p(\phi) = 1/2\pi$$ Using the sampling process as
      described earlier, we arrive at $$\theta = \cos^{-1}(2\xi - 1)$$ $$\phi =
      2\pi \xi$$
      <h3>improvements and next steps</h3>
      See the page on <a href="monte-carlo-variance-reduction.html">[ variance reduction techniques ]</a> for
      instruction on how to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for your monte carlo simulation. These will be particularly
      useful when considering a specific spatial "region of interest" in your simulation and are relatively uninterested in other regions.
