      <h3>Overview</h3>
      Following the initial success of the orbital simulation project, I wanted to see if I could apply what I'd learned to something more complex. The collision physics project was initially supposed to be a minor addition to the orbital code to avoid situations in which massive bodies would pass through each other. In accordance with Newton's law of gravitation, as the distance between the bodies approached zero the force between them approached infinity. I quickly realised that this would be more challenging to implement if I wanted the collisions to be remotely physically accurate. This project is still very much in its early stages, and I have been contemplating switching to another language to better realise my goals with it.
