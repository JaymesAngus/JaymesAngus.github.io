      Jay, 21, he/him. <br><br> I live, work, and study in St Andrews, Scotland. I'm an aspiring astrophysicist and a part time bartender. There are very few topics I don't find fascinating, but I tend to focus on astrobiology, physical simulation, and environmentalism.<br><br>
      This is a homemade collection of loosely organised pages that I use to keep track of my projects and thoughts. This is my first attempt at cultivating a <a href="digitalgarden" class="textlink">[ digital garden ]</a> and as such it may be a little unkempt, but maybe my advocacy of <a href="wildlifegardens" class="textlink">[ wild gardens ]</a> should translate to my digital habits too!
