      <h1>photometry pipeline</h1>
      <hr>
      I am currently working in collaboration with Juan Santisteban of the University of St Andrews on a photometry pipeline which will produce lightcurves
      for the data produced by the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/opticam/project/index.page">OPTICAM</a> system.<br><br> The overarching goal is to produce a python script that
      will load a series of fits images, perform aperture photometry on the detected sources, and then automate a differential photometry 
      process with the selection of a target and reference stars. 
      <hr><br>
    <h3>Progress</h3>
    As of July 12th, we have a working pipeline which can identify sources and perform aperture photometry on each before
    generating a region file to allow the user to select the target and reference stars for differential photometry.
    <br> The next stage is to automate the aperture radii with a greater accuracy using growth curves and identify highly variable sources.
