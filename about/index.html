      <p>
      Jay, 24, he/they.

      <p>
        I write code to combines weather observations with numerical weather prediction models to improve forecasts.

      <h2>Now...</h2>
      <p style="margin-left:1em">
        reading: <a href="/bookshelf/">more often</a><br><br>
        listening to: <a href="https://kompakt-gas.bandcamp.com/album/k-nigsforst">Königsforst by GAS</a><br><br>
        learning about: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65743998-cornish-mining-industry-a-brief-history">the history of mining in Cornwall</a>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p style="margin-left:1em">
        There are few topics I don't find fascinating, but I tend to focus on astrobiology,
        computer simulation, and environmentalism. In recent years I've been particularly interested in the concept of emergence and in the capacity for
        simulations to inform us about the material world.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:1em">
        When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm running, climbing, making music, or freezing in a tent.
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p style="margin-left:1em">
        I completed a master's degree in astrophysics at the University of St Andrews in 2024, specialising in magnetohydrodynamics and computational astrophysics.
        My final year dissertation won the Astrophysics MPhys Project Prize and was later presented at the SUPA Annual Gathering of 2024.<br>

        This website is hosted on GitHub Pages and written entirely by hand. Maybe one day I'll learn how to use a static site generator.

        <a href="https://craze.co.uk/">craze.co.uk</a> and <a href="https://lichendust.com/">lichendust.com</a> were highly influential in the layout
        of this site, though I've tried not to be too derivative.
