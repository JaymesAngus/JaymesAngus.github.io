      This is my growing collection of notes from university courses, papers I've read, and various other sources.
      I began taking atomic notes using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a>, an amazing note-taking resource, and have used a home-cooked python script to convert
      the original markdown files to html ones.<br><br>
      I can't guarantee that any of the information within these notes is 100% accurate,
      but I do my best to make sure it's at least somewhat correct!
