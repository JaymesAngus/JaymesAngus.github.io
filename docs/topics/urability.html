        Urability is a term that you probably haven't heard before. It was
        coined in 2022 by David Deamer, Francesca Cary, and Bruce Damer in a
        paper entitled
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2021.0173" class="textlink"
          ><i
            >[ Urability: A Property of Planetary Bodies That Can Support an
            Origin of Life ]</i
          ></a
        >. Those with an interest in astrobiology may immediately recognise this
        as similar to the concept of habitability; but the crucial distinction
        between these two properties is that while habitability determines
        whether life could persist in an environment, urability determines
        whether life could originate in that environment.

        For example, here on Earth we have extremophiles that thrive in
        conditions of extreme heat, salinity, or pH. These harsh environments
        are therefore habitable (albeit to a strange class of organisms), but
        are not particularly welcoming for simple microbial life - which would
        be unlikely to arise there in an abitrary time.
