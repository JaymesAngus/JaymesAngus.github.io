      <h1>The final parsec problem</h1>
      <hr />
      <br />  
      The final parsec problem is a fascinating concept that represents a lack
      in our understanding of black hole merger events. When two galaxies
      collide, it is exceedingly unlikely that the supermassive black holes at
      their centres themselves collide directly. In reality they likely
      slingshot past each other before being brought together by various braking
      mechanisms.<br /><br />
      The most important braking mechanism is dynamical friction, in which the
      black hole transfers kinetic energy to nearby matter. This mechanism is
      sufficient to bring the two black holes into a stable binary orbit, the
      radius of which decreases over time, until there is so little material in
      their orbital paths that a merger would not occur in the current age of
      the universe. <br /><br />Gravitational waves provide another mechanism
      for energy loss, but their effect does not become impactful until the two
      black holes are orbiting between 0.01 and 0.001 parsecs from each other.
      However, we know that black hole mergers have occurred. Therein lies the
      problem: by what mechanism do merging black holes close this final gap?.

      <h3>proposed solutions</h3>
      The only mechanism that we know to work is highly infrequent and involves
      the presence of a third black hole. In this case there are three more
      mechanisms which allow for energy dissipation:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The orbits may become highly eccentric, allowing two black holes to
          approach the distance at which dissipation of energy via gravitational
          waves becomes effective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two black holes may pass their energy to the third and eject it from
          the system
        </li>
        <li>
          The three black holes will pass through a larger volume of space which
          will therefore contain more matter for dynamical friction.
        </li>
      </ul>
