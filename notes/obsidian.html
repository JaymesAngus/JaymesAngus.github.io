          Obsidian is a free note-taking app with markdown formatting and a unique internal linking feature
          that allows you to visualise the interrelation of your notes.

          While studying for one of the courses in took in the third year of my degree, I was suddenly struck with the realisation that I'd covered
          the material previously. I looked around for the little notebook I knew to contain pages of useful, relevant notes, before realising that 
          I had left it on my bookshelf... Five thousand kilometers across the Atlantic ocean...
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first time I truly appreciated the importance of digitised notes. Historically I have not been a fan of taking notes on a computer,
          mostly due to the inefficiency of writing equations with anything other than a pen and paper. When I came across Obsidian, however, I was 
          immediately drawn in by their signature <i>graph view</i>. Writing in markdown was new to me, but I quickly grew into the workflow and rapidly
          expanded my collection of notes into the network shown above. Obsidian don't pay me, and I'm not much of a reviewer, so I won't go into too
          much detail on the functionality, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has stressed about the longevity of their notes and knowledge.
